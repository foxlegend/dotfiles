This repository contains my dotfiles and some other configuration files.

## Xdefaults

This is my `.Xdefaults` configuration.
It contains my urxvt appearance and behaviour and my xscreensaver lock dialog theme.
The urxvt color theme is based on the zenburn theme.

To use it, the file needs to be copied in the user's home directory as `.Xdefaults`
(do not forget the dot).
	
## zshrc

This is my older `.zshrc` configuration for the zsh Unix shell.

**I am no longer using this configuration.** I prefer the 
[oh-my-zsh](https://bitbucket.org/FoxLegend/oh-my-zsh) configuration.
I forked the 
[robbyrussel's official one](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and
made my own modifications.
To use my current configuration
[please follow this link](https://bitbucket.org/FoxLegend/oh-my-zsh).

If you want to use my old configuration, you will need to copy the `zshrc` file
and `zsh` directory with its content in the user's home directory, as 
respectively `.zshrc` and `.zsh` (do not forget the dots).

## emacs.d

It is my current emacs configuration.

To use it, juste copy the `emacs.d` directory in the user's home directory as `.emacs.d` (do not forget the dot).
